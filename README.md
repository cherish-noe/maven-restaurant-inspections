# Maven Restaurant Inspections Data Analysis

This is Maven Analytics course project I have practiced.

**Purpose** of this project is to build scalable dashboards from inspection data that can be shared for collaboration and my role is as an analyst.

**The dataset** is from Maven Analytics Course.

In the whole project, **Power BI Desktop** is for DAX calculations and **Power BI Service** is for building Dashboard and collaboration.


**Requirements:**

Power BI Desktop 
- only available in Windows
- for Mac, a free solution I prefer to use is running Power BI on Amazon EC2 (can use free for 1 year after creating a new aws account, but don't forget to setup bill alarm because if it exceeds limits what it offers, you will get charged.)

Power BI Service
- only for users who have school mail or work mail
- but with office 365 e5 and e3 trial, you can use Power BI service without having these type of mails
